# WARNING: remote plugins SHOULD NEVER BE USED. Remote plugins are sending your .proto code to buf.build servers. THIS IS NOT A SANCTIONNED PRACTICE AT IBANFIRST. While buf.build advertises remote plugins as a way not have to deal with protoc plugins installation, it is a potential security risk as we can't audit their generator code easily. Depending on remote servers for our build toolchain is also not very smart. Please use local plugins instead.
